1. Main_program: Main.m  

2. Functions:  

	(a) "TF_algorithm.m" : Chirplet Transform(CT), Synchrosqueezing Chirplet Transform(SCT) and Proposed algorithm(HSCT)  
	(b) "Renyi_entropy.m" : Compute Renyi entropy  
	(c) "imageSQ.m" : Function for drawing two-dimensional time-frequency graph  
	(d) "dwindow.m" : Derivative of window function  
	(e) "Check_zero.m" : The function of checking if a vector contains 0  

3. How to implement ?

	(a) Main.m : After running the program, you can execute each block individually. Simply click the window with "%%" and press Ctrl+Enter to get the desired results and images.  
	(b) In the _8th_ row, the parameter Expri: There are 4 experiments in this paper, so you can choose 1 to 4 according to the experiment.
